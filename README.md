# Machine_Learning_Assignments
This is all of my course work for my machine learning class. This class was programmed in R and features many different statistical skills. The work included using many different distributions, making matrices, creating conditional statements, looking at plots and distributions, checking regression fits, and looking at training vs testing data.
